## Disclaimer

ChatCBT is not a replacement for actual therapy or human interaction. Instead, ChatCBT should be thought of as a journaling assistant, similar to an interactive worksheet. It is a bot that responds with objective questions to your writing help you get out of your head and see your problems from other angles.

While the bot draws inspiration from general cognitive-behavioral therapy methods, it has not undergone review or approval by licensed therapists. Though I have personally found ChatCBT useful in managing negative thoughts, it's important to note that this bot was built by someone without domain expertise in pyschology. Also note that AI generates unpredictable responses. You are responsible for deciding whether or not this tool is useful for you. Conisder seeking help from a professional therapist.

You can see the prompts that the bot uses to generate responses here: [chat](https://github.com/clairefro/obsidian-chat-cbt-plugin/blob/main/src/prompts/system.ts) and [summarize](https://github.com/clairefro/obsidian-chat-cbt-plugin/blob/main/src/prompts/summary.ts).

**The creator is not liable for your physical, mental or spiritual health, whether you are using the default prompt or a custom prompt**

I'm happy to hear about any issues you encounter with the bot in the Issues tab, or through a DM to `@clairefroe` on Twitter/X.
